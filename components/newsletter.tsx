            Wildfires are becoming more dangerous with increased intensity, frequency, and duration. This is a result of multiple
            factors such as climate change, urbanization, and human activity. With the earth's temperature rising and the atmosphere losing moisture from extended droughts, the possibility of
            a wildfire is not far off. In fact, the change in the climate has increased the duration of the wildfire season.
            Another source of ignition is a result of human activity. For example, as urbanization of rural areas increases - especially
            in an area with a high affinity for wildfires - the intensity and duration of a wildfire increase as well. As the fire spreads,
            it will eventually reach a house that has either gas, electricity, propane, or even all of the items that are a great source for
            combustion reactions. Similarly, humans also partake in outdoor activities such as camping and hiking where they will leave a fire unattended
            that was not put out properly, they also drop their cigarette butts onto the ground that were also not put out properly.

            Some ways we can combat and mitigate the possibility of a wildfire are to educate yourself when you are
            engaging in an activity that includes fire near heavy vegitation. This includes proper techniques for camping, target shooting
            during hunting season, fireworks, cars, and drones.
